# M-E
Our electronic identity mobile app is designed to make identity verification and accessing government services more convenient. The app features a QR identification function, allowing users to easily prove their identity and provide information by simply scanning a QR code. Users can also access important personal information like identity card and driving license in the profile section, eliminating the need to carry physical copies. The app provides easy one-tap access to commonly-used government digital services like MySST, mySIKAP, MyOnline Passport and MyGovernment. Lastly, the app's notifications feature delivers timely updates and notifications from government agencies directly to the app inbox.

## Security is our utmost priority
We take personal data security seriously, protecting both the users and the agencies. Protocols are in place for authentication, authorization and encryption.

### Authentication
User's identity verified using: <br>
- Submission of IC document through in-app verification machine,  real-time video capture of facial details matched with image from IC, and fingerprint from the device during registration.
- IC number and fingerprint for subsequent access. 

### Authorization
Only the specified agencies can retrieve only the specific personal details consented at the point of transaction. No extra information will be shared. No information will be shared before consent, during QR scanning, or after declining to share information.

### Encryption
Data transmitted between the user and the app server is scrambled and unreadable by anyone else. The app login security protocols will be implemented using the best industry-standard technologies OAuth 2.0.
