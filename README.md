# M-E
Our electronic identity mobile app is designed to make identity verification and accessing government services more convenient. The app features a QR identification function, allowing users to easily prove their identity and provide information by simply scanning a QR code. Users can also access important personal information like identity card and driving license in the profile section, eliminating the need to carry physical copies. The app provides easy one-tap access to commonly-used government digital services like MySST, mySIKAP, MyOnline Passport and MyGovernment. Lastly, the app's notifications feature delivers timely updates and notifications from government agencies directly to the app inbox.
